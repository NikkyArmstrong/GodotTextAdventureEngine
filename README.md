# Godot Text Adventure Engine

A text adventure using the Godot engine. This project started as a secret santa present for a colleague knocked together in two days, and then I improved and extended it to also send to my family for their Christmas.

# The original project

The original text adventure uses references from many popular old text adventures to provide a short couple of puzzles leading to a dragon guarding a "Christmas present". For my secret santa this was the tracking number for their present; for my family this was the link to a cameo.

# Extension

Going forward I would like to convert this from a specific adventure to a template that could be used for anyone to create a text adventure in Godot.
